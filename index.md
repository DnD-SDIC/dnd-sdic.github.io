The "Dungeons, Neurons, and Dialogues: Social Interaction Dynamics in Contextual Games" (DnD-SIDC) workshop aims to explore the forefront of Affective Computing by integrating advanced computational, psychological, and interaction solutions into context-based game interactions to simulate and analyze complex social interaction dynamics. This workshop reflects this year's theme for the Affective Computing and Intelligent Interaction (ACII) 2024 conference, that is, \textit{Humans and Beyond}, by advancing research in intelligent systems that can perceive, express, or utilize affect games using virtual and real robots.

Contextual games like role-playing games (RPGs) offer rich, narrative-driven environments that are ideal for studying and modeling social constructs such as empathy, rivalry, trust, engagement, and competitiveness. These games require players to navigate complex emotional landscapes, make strategic decisions based on social cues, and engage in deep narrative experiences, all within a structured but highly flexible environment. By adding intelligent agents and robots into these scenarios, researchers can investigate how these systems can understand and replicate human social behaviors, adapt to emotional contexts, and contribute to shared experiences in meaningful ways.

The intersection of Affective Computing and social interaction modeling is ripe for exploration. Advances in Machine Learning, Natural Language Processing, and Robotics have provided the necessary tools to create sophisticated and emotionally-aware agents. Furthermore, the global increase in online gaming, especially during the recent pandemic, has highlighted the potential of digital platforms as laboratories for studying Human-Computer Interaction. The DnD-SIDC workshop will explore these aspects to initiate and encourage discussions on the boundaries of what's possible in the realm of social computing and games.

ACII is always a host to a diverse group of researchers, practitioners, and industry professionals who are uniquely equipped to contribute to and benefit from the workshop's objectives. The interdisciplinary nature of ACII fosters collaboration across fields such as psychology, computer science, engineering, and game design, which are all crucial for the successful integration of affective computing principles into context-based games.

The DnD-SIDC workshop hopes to put forth a timely and significant contribution to ACII 2024, towards advancing the state of the art in affective computing and intelligent interaction within the novel and engaging context of complex narrative-driven games.
