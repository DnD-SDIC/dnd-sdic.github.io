    <td><p><a href="#/">Pablo Barros</a> is currently a senior research Scientist at Sony Europe, in Belgium. Since he concluded his PhD at the University of Hamburg, He has worked on affective computing and social robotics over the past years, in particular on the modeling of intrinsic affect on dynamic and contextually rich interactions. His current research interests include the modeling of competitive and cooperative behavior in human dynamics, the exploration of explainable AI for affective perception, and the continual adaptation of social agents towards multiple persons.</p></td>

    <td><p><a href="#/">Laura Triglia</a> is a Ph.D. student specializing in Cognitive Robotics, Interaction, and Rehabilitation Technologies. Her research aims to investigate and thoroughly understand how mutual trust can influence the interaction between humanoid robots and humans. Having graduated in Robotics Engineering from the University of Genoa in 2022, she defended her thesis titled 'Adaptive Robotic Architecture: Exploring the Impact of Trust on Social Interaction.' This research initiative was dedicated to untangling the complexities of trust dynamics within interactions between humans and robots.</p></td>
