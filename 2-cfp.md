All papers are to be submitted via the [EasyChair submission system](https://easychair.org/conferences/submissions?a=30547390) and will be peer-reviewed in a **double-blind** fashion. 

<!-- **Proceedings:** The accepted workshop papers will appear in the ACII Demo and Workshop Proceedings. These could be in the form of short (2-4 pages) or long (6-8 pages) contributions. Authors will be invited to present their accepted papers in an oral presentation during the workshop.  -->
<!-- Papers that do not meet the acceptance threshold, will be invited for poster presentations (papers not to be included in the proceedings). -->

<!-- **Poster Session:** Researchers are further invited to submit their preliminary or work-in-progress contributions as a 1-page extended abstract for poster presentation. The authors will receive a notification of acceptance after a light review that only examines fit and factual correctness, but they will receive feedback from the audience during the workshop. These 1-page extended abstracts will not appear in the workshop proceedings. -->
